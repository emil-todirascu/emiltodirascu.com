                Ever since I was very little I loved the idea of having my own little piece of the internet where I can
                show whatever I want to the world.
                <br><br>
                This website's main purpose is to serve as an information page for
                people who are interested in finding out more about myself. I showcase things like my education and
                skills, which may interest others that don't know me on a personal level.

                While working on my website I truly learned a lot. This was one of my first real projects that had a
                clear end goal.
                <br><br>
                Going into it, my HTML and CSS skills were not very developed. I definitely had a lot to learn. Now, I
                am way more confident and I can say I know how to use them and what some of the best practices are.
                <br><br>
                Similarly, I did have an alright understanding of GitHub beforehand, but this project gave me a bit more
                experience with it and allowed me to explore some other features I did not know of before. As for
                JavaScript, I did not use it much in this project as there was no real need for it; only very small
                things.
                <br><br>
                Another important thing I learned was web design. I went through several iterations of the website
                before I settled on the current design. In fact, I will likely keep changing it as I learn more about
                design and what works best.
