                        action and adventure single players to MOBAs. Some of my all time favourites are: Portal 1/2,
                        Red Dead Redemption 2, APB: Reloaded, Team Fortress 2, League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics.
                        I like games and hope that one day I may be able to work on one.

                        I have also studied the stock market and educated myself on it. I am truly fascinated by it and
                        enjoy observing how news and governmental decisions affect stocks.

                        enjoy swing and electro swing. I listen to music almost daily as it helps me concentrate on work
                        as well as relax. I also go to clubs and concerts from time to time.
